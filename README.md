<h1>Automation scripts</h1>

This repository contains Python scripts automating certain workflows. <br>
<ul>
<li>
    <i><strong>DocToPdfConverter.py</strong></i>: As the name suggests, 
    this script automatically converts Word documents 
    in a given folder specified by the absolute path to PDF. To use the script, an installation of Microsoft Word
    and a valid license is required.
</li>
<li>
    <i><strong>multi-repo-clone.sh</strong></i>: This bash script was written for simplifying `git clone` for a large amount of repositories, such it is the case in microservice architectures, where each repo contains the source code for one microservice.
</li>
</ul>
